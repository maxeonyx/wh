# wh Vision

wh aims to mimic the Windows 11 voice typing experience while running entirely locally with Whisper.

- Ship as a single self-contained `wh.exe`
- Minimal runtime dependencies; no Python or Node.js
- Activate via the `Win+H` global hotkey
- Automatically download Whisper models to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/wh/models`
- Keep tooling lightweight and portable, installed in `.toolchain/`
- Study [OpenWhispr](https://github.com/HeroTools/open-whispr) for UX and model-management ideas only
